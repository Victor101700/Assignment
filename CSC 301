# Number Checker Program

This program, written in Python, prompts the user to enter a number and uses structured programming concepts to determine if the number is zero, even, or odd.

## How it Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a number.
2. The program checks if the entered number is zero, even, or odd using if-else statements and modular arithmetic.
3. The program prints the appropriate message based on the condition.

## Usage

1. Run the program (`main.py`).
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. The program will display whether the number is zero, even, or odd.

## Example

```bash
Enter a number: 8
The entered number is even.
